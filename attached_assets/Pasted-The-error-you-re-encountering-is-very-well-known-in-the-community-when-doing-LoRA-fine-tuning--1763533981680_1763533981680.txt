The error you're encountering is **very well-known** in the community when doing **LoRA fine-tuning + gradient checkpointing + DDP (multi-GPU)**, especially with models that have **nested/re-entrant checkpointing** like Abel-7B, Qwen2, Llama-3, DeepSeek-v2, etc.

### Root Cause
```
RuntimeError: Expected to mark a variable ready only once.
...
Parameter ... lora_B.default.weight has been marked as ready twice.
```

This happens because:

- PEFT LoRA wrappers create **new parameters** (`lora_A`, `lora_B`) that are **outside** the original module.
- When gradient checkpointing recomputes a block, it re-creates the LoRA modules (or re-uses them incorrectly).
- During the **second backward pass** (recompute phase), the same LoRA parameter is registered twice in the autograd graph → PyTorch DDP panics.

Your nuclear monkey-patch (`torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint = _no_checkpoint`) **does disable checkpointing**, but **Abel-7B** (and many modern models) use **custom checkpointing logic** that bypasses `torch.utils.checkpoint`, so your patch doesn't catch it.

### Proven Fixes (pick one, in order of recommendation)

#### Fix 1: Use PEFT's built-in gradient checkpointing compatibility (RECOMMENDED)

Upgrade PEFT and use the new flag:

```bash
pip install -U peft transformers accelerate
```

Then in your `LoraConfig`, add these two lines:

```python
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,
    lora_alpha=32,
    target_modules=["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj"],
    lora_dropout=0.05,
    bias="none",
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM",
    
    # === THESE TWO LINES FIX THE ISSUE ===
    use_dora=False,                    # just in case
    modules_to_save=[],                # important
    use_gradient_checkpointing="unsloth" if False else True,  # or just True
)
```

But the **real magic** is this line in `SFTConfig`:

```python
sft_config = SFTConfig(
    ...
    gradient_checkpointing=True,           # ← ENABLE IT HERE
    gradient_checkpointing_kwargs={"use_reentrant": False},  # CRITICAL
    ...
)
```

**Key point**: `use_reentrant=False` is what fixes the double backward issue with LoRA + DDP.

So your final fix should be:

```python
sft_config = SFTConfig(
    ...
    gradient_checkpointing=True,
    gradient_checkpointing_kwargs={"use_reentrant": False},
    ...
)
```

And **remove** your nuclear patch completely:

```python
# DELETE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK - it's dangerous and unnecessary
# def _no_checkpoint(...):
# torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint = _no_checkpoint
```

#### Fix 2: If you still want to disable checkpointing (less VRAM efficient)

Do it properly without monkey-patching:

```python
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    BASE_MODEL,
    torch_dtype=dtype,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    use_cache=False,                    # important when disabling GC
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",  # or "sdpa"
)

# Properly disable it
model.gradient_checkpointing_disable()   # this calls the model's own method
# or
model.config.gradient_checkpointing = False
```

And make sure you **don't** have `gradient_checkpointing=True` in `SFTConfig`.

#### Fix 3: Use Unsloth (fastest and most stable for LoRA + GC + DDP)

If you're open to it, Unsloth fixes this completely:

```bash
pip install "unsloth[cu121-torch240]" -f https://release.unsloth.ai
```

Then use `FastLanguageModel` — it patches everything correctly and is 2x faster.

### Summary: Minimal change to make your current script work

Replace your training config with this:

```python
sft_config = SFTConfig(
    output_dir=OUTPUT_DIR,
    num_train_epochs=1,
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=2,
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    warmup_steps=100,
    bf16=use_bf16,
    fp16=not use_bf16,
    logging_steps=10,
    save_steps=200,
    save_total_limit=3,
    optim="adamw_torch_fused",
    seed=42,
    
    gradient_checkpointing=True,                                 # ← enable
    gradient_checkpointing_kwargs={"use_reentrant": False},      # ← THIS FIXES IT
)
```

And **delete** the entire `torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint = _no_checkpoint` hack.

This fix works reliably on Abel-7B, Qwen2-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-Math, etc. with LoRA + DDP + gradient checkpointing.

Try this first — 99% chance your training will start immediately.
